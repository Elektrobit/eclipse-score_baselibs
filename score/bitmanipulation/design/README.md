# Detailed Design

This library provides only utility functionality for bit-manipulation.

Thus, it just aggregates loose and small functions that are not coupled in any means other than that they are around the
topic of bit-manipulation.

Based on that there is no benefit in providing a detailed design - as there is none in its original matter.
