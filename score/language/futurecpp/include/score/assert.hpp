/// Default-level assert.
/// If the asserted condition evaluates to false at runtime, the assertion handler will get invoked. \see score::cpp::handler.
///
/// Each macro has a normal and a `_MESSAGE` form, where the latter takes a user supplied string as an additional
/// argument that will be passed on to the assertion handler.
///
/// It is possible to introduce state in assertion handling which manifests in storing a void* pointer pointing to a
/// "User Data" structure of unspecified format. Proper creation, destruction, and overall handling of this structure is
/// entirely on caller's responsibility. Setting this pointer is possible with set_user_data() while retrieving can be
/// done with get_user_data(). Upon assertion struct handler_parameters is automatically populated with that value.
///
/// The amount of assertions that get compiled into the code depends on the configured assertion level:
///  * Default level checks will be compiled unless `SCORE_LANGUAGE_FUTURECPP_ASSERT_LEVEL_PRODUCTION` is defined.
///  * Debug level checks will only be compiled if `SCORE_LANGUAGE_FUTURECPP_ASSERT_LEVEL_DEBUG` is defined.
///  * Production level checks will always be compiled.
