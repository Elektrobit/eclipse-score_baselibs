/// \brief The stop_source class provides the means to issue a stop request, such as for score::cpp::jthread cancellation. A
/// stop request made for one stop_source object is visible to all stop_sources and score::cpp::stop_tokens of the same
/// associated stop-state; any score::cpp::stop_callback(s) registered for associated score::cpp::stop_token(s) will be invoked,
/// and any std::condition_variable_any objects waiting on associated score::cpp::stop_token(s) will be awoken.
///
/// Once a stop is requested, it cannot be withdrawn. Additional stop requests have no effect.
///
/// \details For the purposes of score::cpp::jthread cancellation the stop_source object should be retrieved from the
/// score::cpp::jthread object using get_stop_source(); or stop should be requested directly from the score::cpp::jthread object using
/// request_stop(). This will then use the same associated stop-state as that passed into the score::cpp::jthread's invoked
/// function argument (i.e., the function being executed on its thread).
///
/// For other uses, however, a stop_source can be constructed separately using the default constructor, which creates
/// new stop-state.
