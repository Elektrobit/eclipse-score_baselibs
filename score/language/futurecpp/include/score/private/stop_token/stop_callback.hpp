/// \brief The stop_callback class template provides an RAII object type that registers a callback function for an
/// associated score::cpp::stop_token object, such that the callback function will be invoked when the score::cpp::stop_token's
/// associated score::cpp::stop_source is requested to stop.
///
/// Callback functions registered via stop_callback's constructor are invoked either in the same thread that
/// successfully invokes request_stop() for a score::cpp::stop_source of the stop_callback's associated score::cpp::stop_token; or if
/// stop has already been requested prior to the constructor's registration, then the callback is invoked in the thread
/// constructing the stop_callback.
///
/// More than one stop_callback can be created for the same score::cpp::stop_token, from the same or different threads
/// concurrently. No guarantee is provided for the order in which they will be executed, but they will be invoked
/// synchronously; except for stop_callback(s) constructed after stop has already been requested for the
/// score::cpp::stop_token, as described previously.
///
/// If an invocation of a callback exits via an exception then std::terminate is called.
///
/// score::cpp::stop_callback is not CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable, MoveConstructible, nor MoveAssignable.
///
/// The template param Callback type must be both invocable and destructible. Any return value is ignored.
///
/// \details Deviation from the C++20 Standard
///
/// As per standard the class stop_callback shall be templated in order to support the member `callback_type` referring
/// to the respective type. At the same time the standard foresees a custom "Class template argument deduction (CTAD)"
/// in a way that the user of this library would not need to specify the class template parameter and thus could just
/// construct `score::cpp::stop_callback cb{my_token, my_callback};` The problem is that "Class template argument deduction
/// (CTAD)" is only supported from C++17 on. With us only supporting C++14, there seems no way to implement this
/// correctly. The trade-off needs to be made between either sticking to the _nice_ user API and removing the template
/// parameter and `callback_type` or keeping the template parameter and forcing the user to specify the type. We decided
/// for former, since it seems to be the more clean way.
///
/// This comes with the drawback that right now only callables with the signature `void()` can be used. The standard for
/// sees anyhow only callbacks with parameters, but allows theoretically a different return value other than void (which
/// will be thrown away). Thus, the drawback does not seem to be high.
