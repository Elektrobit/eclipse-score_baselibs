/// @brief RecursiveDirectoryIterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the DirectoryEntry elements of a
/// directory, and, recursively, over the entries of all subdirectories. The iteration order is unspecified, except that
/// each directory entry is visited only once.
///
/// Symlinks are not followed.
///
/// The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.
///
/// If the RecursiveDirectoryIterator reports an error or is advanced past the last directory entry of the top-level
/// directory, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators
/// are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.
///
/// If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the recursive directory iterator has been
/// created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.
///
/// If the directory structure contains cycles, the end iterator may be unreachable.
